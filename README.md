# cah_card_generator
Think you're funny enough to make your own Cards Against Humanity cards?  
This app let's you type up some Black and White CaH cards and it will generate the images for you.  
It creates individual card images (409px by 585px PNGs)  
It also creates 10x7 deck sheet images (4090px by 4095px PNGs)  
This is for easy import into Tabletop Simulator (its default custom card/deck sizes)
